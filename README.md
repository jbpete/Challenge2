# Bootcamp Challenge2

## Description
The purpose of this project was to create a project portfolio that can be modified in the future with the deployed applications I create in the bootcamp. THis will be both a good reference and example of what I am capable of when interviewing with potential employers. This challenge was difficult as it was our first homework with starter code which forced me to apply all I have learned about HTML and CSS styling up until this point. I struggled with certain aspects but I believe I created a good foundation to build on going forward.

I created a header with my name and navigation links to each of the content sections. The links work and will scroll down to the relevant location.

I created a section for the work I have accomplished. Currently I have just used placeholders until I can replace with real deployed applications.
